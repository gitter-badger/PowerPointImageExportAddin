# PowerPointImageExportAddin
Small PowerPoint Addin that enables the user to export the current slide in all formats 
supported by Powerpoint in a user defined resolution.

The default resolution when exporting a PowerPoint presentation to an image format is 96 dpi. If users want to use a higher resolution 
they have to change the default value in the Windows registry (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827745).

This addin lets users choose the format and resolution of the image export without the need to edit the registry.
